The ConstructJASPAR2024Key.sh script downloads the set of JASPAR 2024 CORE plant motifs and prepare a key grouping them into clusters as defined by JASPAR.

01_SRA_download.sh downloads raw reads from SRA given a list of accession numbers (found in supplementary data). 
We use these raw reads to generate dozens of new short read assemblies.

In addition, we downloaded existing assemblies from NCBI, Phytozome, CoGE, and Ag Data Commons (from Schulz 2023, Schulz 2025 (in prep)). 
See supplementary data for a full list of assembly sources.
