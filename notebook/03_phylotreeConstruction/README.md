Here're the notebooks for phylogeny reconstruction and visualization:

In 00, focusing on the angiosperm353 loci, we constructed gene trees using RAxML and reconcile species tree from the gene tree using ASTRAL2.
01 noted how we obtain the genetic distance among individual taxa based on the angiosperm353 and tree visualization.
02 plots traits of interest on the tree (Figs 1, 5c)
