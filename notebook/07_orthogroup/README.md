Here're the notebooks to construct and filter the orthogroups (OG).
With 32 representative high quality long read assemblies, we constructed orthogroups using orthofinder as 07A.
Constructed OGs were filtered based on the (1) # of taxa presence (>8) and (2) max. # of copy per taxa (<100) as 07B.
Ancestral protein sequences of the filtered OGs were reconstructed as 07A and query against all assemblies using miniProt as in 07C.
MiniProt alignment results were evaluated in 07D.
