Here're the notebooks for envirotyping of the studied species:

In 09A, we process the metadata to obtain current and historical species names of the studied taxa.

As documented in 09B, we queried the occurrence records based on the list of species names on BIEN and GBIF and extracted the environmental data of each occurrence coordinate.

The summarization of environmental characteristics (PCA) for  each species were documented in 09C.
