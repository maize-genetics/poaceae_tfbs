Here're the notebooks for envirotyping of the studied species:

In 09A, we process the metadata to obtain current and historical species names of the studied taxa.

We queried the occurrence records based on the list of species names on BIEN and GBIF using 09B.

Extraction of environmental data of each occurrence coordinate, and summarization (PCA) for  each species were documented in 09C.
