These notebooks run cross-species association models with asreml, associating motif features with environmental PCs.
00: Calculates mono and di-nucleotide frequencies in short introns across species to use as a covariate in the global association models.
01: Runs global association models
02: Runs orthogroup-specific association models
03: Prepares data for genome browser visualization of HSF/GARP motif variation between rice and Zizania
